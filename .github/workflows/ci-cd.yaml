#### 4. **Commit the Workflow File**
- Commit the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file and push it to your GitHub repository.

#### 5. **Test the Workflow**
- Once the workflow file is in your main branch, any push to the branch will trigger the workflow.
- You can monitor the workflow run in the 'Actions' tab of your GitHub repository.

#### 6. **Configure Secrets for Docker Hub (if applicable)**
- If your workflow includes pushing to Docker Hub, you'll need to set up secrets in your GitHub repository for your Docker Hub username and access token.
- Go to the 'Settings' tab of your GitHub repository, then to 'Secrets', and add your Docker Hub credentials as secrets.

### Next Steps
After setting up your CI/CD pipeline, every push to your repository will trigger the build and (optionally) deployment process. This automates the integration and delivery of your updates, streamlining your development workflow.
